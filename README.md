# Ferroelectric-Negative-Capacitances
Currently CMOS technology is facing two main fundamental problems/limitations in scaling down
by both power disscipation and size -
1.Boltzmann Limit that limits the subthreshold swing S i.e (slope of the gate voltage vs log scale
Drain Current) to 60 mV/decade.
2.The dimensional size of channel cannot be reduced below a certain range to avoid the kicking
in of the tunnelling effects.
Accessing the Negative Capacitance regime of the ferroelectric oxides can essentially be one of the
ways to overcoming the above two fundamental limits. This term paper will explain the basic concept
of Negative Capacitances in detail and in particular the Ferroelectric type of Negative Capacitances
and explore how to realize the Negative Capacitance in CMOS technology.
